Transfection of the c.-258 C>G variant in K562 human erythroid cells found that it is associated with a 94% decrease in promoter activity compared to wildtype (Bekri et al., 2003). The affected mother was also found to have reduced ALAS2 mRNA expression in erythroid precursors (Bekri et al., 2003).

GeneDx summary: This variant is denoted SDHB c.423+1G>A or IVS4+1G>A and consists of a G>A nucleotide substitution at the +1 position of intron 4 of the SDHB gene. This variant destroys a canonical splice donor site and has been shown to result in the use of an alternate splice site 54 base pairs upstream in exon 4, resulting in an in-frame deletion of 18 amino acids within the 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain (Bayley 2006, Ercolino 2009, UniProt). This variant has been published in multiple individuals with a personal history of tumors related to the Hereditary Paraganglioma-Pheochromocytoma syndrome, many of which are reported to show absence of the SDHB protein via immunohistochemistry (Bayley 2006, Benn 2006, Burnichon 2009, Casc?n 2009, Ercolino 2009, Erlic 2009, Meyer-Rochow 2009, Hes 2010, Gill 2011, Hensen 2012, Heesterman 2013, Gill 2014, van Hulsteijn 2014, Curr?s-Freixes 2015, D?nes 2015, Niemeijer 2015, Sue 2015, Imamura 2016). SDHB c.423+1G>A has been shown to segregate with disease in families (Hes 2010, Gill 2011) and has been reported as a founder variant in the Dutch population (Hesen 2012, Heesterman 2013, van Hulsteijn 2014). While some studies of this population have suggested that this variant may have reduced penetrance compared to other SDHB pathogenic variants, other studies did not demonstrate a difference in penetrance (Hes 2010, van Hulsteijn 2014, Rijken 2017). Based on the currently available evidence, we consider SDHB c.423+1G>A to be pathogenic. Invitae summary: This sequence change affects a donor splice site in intron 4 of the SDHB gene. It is expected to disrupt RNA splicing and likely results in an absent or disrupted protein product. This variant is present in population databases (rs398122805, ExAC 0.001%). This variant has been reported in individuals with paraganglioma (PGL) and/or pheochromocytoma (PCC), and shown to segregate with disease in two families (PMID: 16405730, 20540712, 21348866, 19411806, 19825962, 25047027). This variant is also commonly found in Dutch patients with PGL/PCC (PMID: 16405730, 21348866, 25047027). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 29896). Analysis of mRNA in affected patients demonstrated that this variant leads to the utilization of a cryptic splice site 54 nucleotides upstream of the original donor splice site and exclusion of 18 amino acids from the translated protein (PMID: 16405730, 19411806). Experimental studies testing the functional impact of this in-frame deletion have not been reported. For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic.",0,,G,A,,,

(2013) identified homozygosity for a 4-bp deletion (c.53344_53347delAAGT) at the splice donor site of exon 7 of the TTC7A gene. The deletion was found in heterozygosity in both parents from each family, as well as both parents from 2 more French Canadian families in which DNA was unavailable from the deceased affected children. Unaffected sibs in these families were either heterozygous for the deletion or did not carry it at all. Sequencing of the cDNA product from patient RNA revealed that exon 7 was skipped, with splicing of exon 6 directly to exon 8; this aberrant splicing generated a 158-bp deletion in the resulting cDNA, predicted to cause a frameshift with 49 new amino acids followed by a termination codon. In human lymphocyte RNA sequencing data from other unrelated projects, Samuels et al. (2013) found rare examples of reads skipping exon 7, with 4 of 880 reads excluding exon 7; they suggested that exon 7 inclusion may be intrinsically variable even with a wildtype splice donor site. In 2 affected sibs from a seventh French Canadian family, Samuels et al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for the 4-bp deletion and a c.13307A-G transition in exon 20 of the TTC7A gene, resulting in a leu823-to-pro (L823P; 609332.0002) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the carboxy terminus. The authors concluded that the 4-bp deletion represents a founder mutation in the French Canadian population, with the L823P missense mutation having arisen more recently or being derived from a British or Scottish population. In a 2-year-old boy (patient F5-A) with combined immunodeficiency and multiple intestinal atresia, Chen et al. (2013) identified compound heterozygosity for the 4-bp deletion, which they designated c.1000_1003delAAGT (chr2.47,221,651delAAGT, GRCh37) and 2 deleterious single-nucleotide variants on the other allele of the TTC7A gene (609332.0008). The patient inherited the 4-bp deletion from his unaffected French Canadian father. Quantitative RT-PCR of patient fibroblasts showed reduced expression of TTC7A, to 54% of control levels, and confirmed that the 4-bp deletion causes skipping of exon 7.",0,,AAGT,-,,,

(1996) identified an A-to-G transition at position 146 of the FTL gene in heterozygous state in an 8-year-old boy and his father, both of whom had hyperferritinemia and cataract. The paternal grandfather also suffered from cataract. Both parents were of French origin. The mother had normal ferritin levels and no cataract. Both this and the 147G-C mutation (134790.0002) involved the 5-base sequence (CAGUG) that characterizes the loop structure of the IRE. (This A-to-G mutation appears to be the same as the A-to-G mutation reported by Beaumont et al. (1995) since the IRE contains only 1 adenine residue.) Beaumont et al. (1995) demonstrated that affected members of a 3-generation family with autosomal dominant hyperferritinemia and cataract (HRFTC; 600886) carried a heterozygous A-to-G transition in the iron-responsive element (IRE) of the FTL gene. The authors referred to the variant as 40A-G. Affected members presented with early-onset bilateral cataract. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated deposits of dust-like spots (pulverulent cataract) in all layers of both lens. There were no other clinical manifestations. All affected members had an elevated level of circulating ferritin with no other hematologic or biochemical abnormalities. Genetic hemochromatosis was excluded by liver biopsy which showed no iron overload but a heavy deposit of lipofuscin pigment in hepatocytes thought to be due to the accumulation of L ferritin. Affected members of the family had an A-to-G transition in the highly conserved CAGUGU motif that constitutes the IRE loop and mediates the high-affinity interaction with the iron regulatory protein (100880). They showed that the mutation abolished the finding of IRP in vitro and leads to a high constitutive, poorly regulated L ferritin synthesis in cultured lymphoblastoid cells established from affected patients. In a large kindred in which 11 members had hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome, McLeod et al. (2002) identified the same mutation in the conserved CAGUG motif. They referred to the mutation as an A-to-G change at nucleotide 40.

(1986) found a cytosine-to-thymine transition at position -196 of the A-gamma gene promoter. This mutation at position -196 has been found in unrelated persons with the same phenotype from Italy and Sardinia. These mutations apparently arose independently since they are associated with different haplotypes. In Italians with the A-gamma (beta+) form of HPFH, Waber et al. (1986) found a C-to-T change at position -196. In the Sardinian delta-beta-thalassemia, there are 2 mutations: the mutation in the HBG1 gene at position -196 and the beta-0-thalassemia mutation at codon 39 of the HBB gene (141900.0312). The mutation at position -196 is associated with high levels of production of fetal hemoglobin. The beta-39 nonsense mutation may have gotten onto the -196 chromosome through crossing-over. A chromosome carrying such a double mutation could be expected to impart selective advantage because the beta-thalassemia would protect against malaria while the increased gamma-globin production would ameliorate the severity of the beta-thalassemia (Pirastu et al., 1987). This chromosome with mutations in 2 closely linked loci leads to so-called Sardinian nondeletional delta-beta-thalassemia; more frequently, delta-beta-thalassemia results from extensive deletions of the beta-globin gene cluster. Loudianos et al. (1992) sequenced the delta-globin gene (142000) in a case of Sardinian nondeletional delta-beta-thalassemia and found it to be entirely normal. They concluded that the deficient function of the delta-globin gene is probably due to the suppressive effect of the in cis nondeletional high persistence of fetal hemoglobin mutation in the HBG1 gene.

This gene is transcribed from two promoters to produce ubiquitous and erythroid specific isoforms of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). In the classical form of AIP, both isoforms are deficient, but about 5% of families have the non-erythroid variant in which only the ubiquitous isoform is affected. Only one mutation sited in the housekeeping promoter has been previously reported as causative for this form of AIP. In this study, we identified one small deletion and six nucleotide substitutions within the 5'UTR and the housekeeping promoter of HMBS gene: c.1-440_-427del14bp; c.1-421G>A; c.1-331C>T; c.1-270G>A; c.1-122T>A; c.1-103C>T; c.1-28A>C. Using luciferase reporter assays and quantitative PCR experiments, we characterized the functional role of these seven novel genetic variants demonstrating that all mutations cause a significant loss of transcriptional activity. Our investigations suggest that these nucleotide substitutions may alter critical binding sites for transcriptional factors, which confirms that these regions represent an important molecular target for pathogenesis of non-erythroid form of acute intermittent porphyria.

(1991) identified 2 mutations in the 5-prime region of the RB gene in patients with retinoblastoma (180200). One was a G-to-T transversion 189 bp 5-prime to the initiating methionine codon; the second was a G-to-A transition 198 bp upstream of the initiating methionine codon (614041.0018). The penetrance of these mutations appeared to be low; both carriers in 1 family had only unilateral retinoblastoma, and there were at least 3 obligate carriers who had no retinoblastoma in the second family. The mutation in the first family was within a sequence homologous to the consensus sequence for ATF, a transcription factor related or identical to CREB1 (123810). The second mutation was within a sequence similar to that recognized by SP1 (189906), a transcription factor with a zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Sakai et al. (1991) demonstrated that these natural mutants did not bind the transcription factors mentioned. The incomplete penetrance of the mutations may be related to the fact that the mutations result in a quantitative decrease in the expression of the RB gene, rather than in its complete inactivity.

The usually mild anemia of CHH is most probably self-limited. However, over half of CHH patients with severe anemia may require life-long transfusions and bone marrow transplantation (Williams et al., 2005).In an Austrian boy with metaphyseal chondrodysplasia without hypotrichosis (MDWH; 250460), Bonafe et al. (2002) identified compound heterozygosity for mutations in the RMRP gene: the common Finnish 70A-G mutation and a 238C-T transition (157660.0009).Ridanpaa et al. (2001) identified homozygosity for an A-to-G transition at nucleotide 70 (70A-G) of the RMRP gene in 42 Finnish families with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH; 250250), including 12 with more than 1 affected child and 30 with a single affected child. All of these families carried modifications of the ancestral haplotype of DNA polymorphisms. In additional CHH patients, the authors identified the 70A-G mutation in compound heterozygosity with another RMRP mutation (e.g., 157660.0002). Another patient, who had been described as patient A by Sulisalo et al. (1997), had uniparental disomy for chromosome 9 with 2 copies of the maternal, 70A-G mutation-carrying chromosome, and no paternal chromosome 9. The 70A-G mutation was detected in heterozygosity in 1 of 120 Finnish control samples and in 2 of 160 non-Finnish control samples.Ridanpaa et al. (2003) found homozygosity for the common Finnish mutation in 2 of 20 Canadian patients diagnosed with Schmid-type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (156500) without the usual autosomal dominant mutation in COL10A1 (120110). The patients later developed features more typical of CHH.Ridanpaa et al. (2003) reported that the most frequent, and perhaps only, mutation causing CHH in the Old Order Amish in the United States (in whom the disorder was first described) is the same 70A-G transition that is the major mutation causing CHH in Finns. They stated that although more than 40 different mutations in the RMRP gene had been characterized in other populations, 70A-G was the most common CHH-causing mutation worldwide. The mutation segregates with the same major haplotype in Finns and Amish and others, suggesting that it is very ancient.The so-called Finnish-Amish common transition 70A-G was observed in 12 alleles among 22 confirmed CHH patients (27%) by Hermanns et al.

The r.(71 a>g) variant is the most common pathogenic variant in the RMRP gene, and in the Finnish population the carrier frequency for this variant has been estimated to be as high as 1 in 76 (Sulisalo et al., 1994). This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. Functional analysis of the r.(71 a>g) variant found that it is associated with reduced cleavage activity and abnormal ribosomal processing (Thiel et al., 2007; Hermanns et al., 2005). Therefore, we consider this variant to be pathogenic.",0,,A,G,,,

OMIM summary: In 2 unrelated individuals with Tourette syndrome (137580), Abelson et al. (2005) identified a G-to-A substitution in the 3-prime UTR of the SLITRK1 gene at position +689 from the TAA stop codon. This variant, termed var321, replaces a G:U wobble base pair with an A:U Watson-Crick pairing at position 9 of the miRNA189 binding domain within SLITRK1. In 1 of the families, this mutation was also identified in the proband's mother, who had facial tics. This variant was absent from 4,296 control chromosomes, demonstrating a statistically significant association with Tourette syndrome (p = 0.0056; Fisher's exact test). Scharf et al. (2008) identified var321 in 1 (0.1%) of 1,048 individuals with Tourette syndrome. This individual also had obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; 164230) and trichotillomania (TTM; 613229), but did not transmit the variant to their child who was affected with Tourette syndrome. Var321 was also identified in another parent of a child with Tourette syndrome, but the parent did not have the disorder, although she did meet criteria for OCD. However, again, she did not transmit the variant to the affected child. Scharf et al. (2008) concluded that SLITRK1 is not associated with Tourette syndrome in their cohort. The authors also noted that both parents with the variant were of Jewish families from Eastern Europe, where var321 has been suggested to be benign polymorphism (Keen-Kim et al., 2006). To defend their original findings (Abelson et al., 2005), O'Roak et al. (2010) performed genomewide genotyping combined with multidimensional scaling analysis and dense haplotype mapping on carriers of the var321 allele, including the individuals from their orignal study. These individuals and another newly identified affected Spanish proband with the variant were all found not to be of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. O'Roak et al.

The FBN2 mutation resulted in the identical missplicing of exon 34 in both patients. Significantly, the mother was a somatic mosaic for the mutation, thus explaining her milder phenotype. The mutation consisted of an A-to-T transversion at the -2 position of the consensus acceptor splice site, changing AG to TG at the 3-prime end of intron 33. The mother had been born with congenital contractures of the hands, elbows, and knees. Elbow and knee contractures improved spontaneously, and in childhood she underwent surgical release of finger contractures. In adolescence, mitral valve prolapse was recognized. At the age of 24 years, she delivered a premature daughter who was recognized as having CCA on the first day of life. Pregnancy was complicated by a third-trimester polyhydramnios and spontaneous delivery at 34 weeks of gestation. She was diagnosed with type-B interrupted aortic arch with large ventricular septal defect and moderate atrial septal defect, duodenal atresia and intestinal malrotation, single umbilical artery, vertebral anomalies, and arachnodactyly with contractures of elbows and knees. Both ears showed a crumpled irregular superior helix and prominent antihelix and root of the helix. There was pectus excavatum. Duodenal atresia was repaired on day 3, interrupted aortic arch was repaired at 1 month of age, and gastrostomy tube was placed for gastroesophageal reflux requiring subsequent jejunostomy because of gastric perforation, at the age of 1.5 months.

This variant has been reported in the homozygous state in multiple individuals affected with Pelizaeusâ€šÃ„Ã¬Merzbacher-like disease (PMID: 21246605, 20695017) and has been reported to segregate with this disorder in several families (PMID: 21959080, 23142375). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 30759). Experimental studies have shown that this variant reduces expression from the GJC2 promotor (PMID: 20695017, 24374284) and disrupts the binding of the SOX10 transcription factor (PMID: 24374284), although an additional study reports conflicting results (PMID: 21246605). For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic. OMIM summary: Combes et al. (2012) identified the -167A-G mutation in 7 patients with a disorder similar to that in the Japanese patient reported by Osaka et al. (2010). The mutation was homozygous in 5 patients from 4 unrelated families from the same area of south Tunisia and segregated with the disease in a consanguineous family with 2 affected members; it was also found in 2 unrelated patients from the Mediterranean area in compound heterozygosity with another mutation in the GJC2 gene that had been identified by Henneke et al. (2008) in patients with HLD2. The mutation was not found in 212 healthy individuals from the same geographic regions. Functional studies in COS-7 and HEK293 cells demonstrated a higher luciferase expression with the mutated promoter than with the wildtype, suggesting a possible difference in transcription factor recruitment. In a Japanese female with a mild Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disorder (HLD2; 608804) who was previously reported by Nezu et al. (1996), Osaka et al. (2010) identified a homozygous -167A-G mutation within the proximal GJC2 promoter that segregated with the disorder. The patient's healthy, second-cousin parents were heterozygous for the mutation, which was not found in 122 normal Japanese chromosomes. The mutation is located within a critical SOX10 binding site (site D) in the syntenic mouse Gjc2 proximal promoter and diminishes the consensus of the SOX binding sequence. Functional studies on the mouse promoter indicated that the -167A-G mutation abolishes SOX10 binding to the GJC2 promoter, resulting in a dramatic attenuation of GJC2 transcription. Using a new reporter luciferase assay in a human glioblastoma cell line (U138), Gotoh et al. (2014) demonstrated that the -167A-G mutation reduced transcriptional activity compared to wildtype in response to SOX10 (602229).

The mutation occurred in a microRNA-binding site (MIRN140; 611894), and was predicted to foster suppressive miRNA-mediated effects on translation, leading to less available REEP1 protein.  GeneDx summary: The c.*43 G>T sequence change has been reported previously as c.606+43 G>T in several unrelated individuals with complicated and uncomplicated hereditary spastic paraplegia, however segregation analysis was not performed for these individuals (ZÃ¼chner et al., 2006; Beetz et al., 2008; Schlang et al., 2008; Hewamadduma et al., 2009; Mishra et al., 2009; McCorquodale et al., 2011; Elert-Dobkowska et al., 2015). The c.*43 G>T variant is located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the REEP1 gene at a position that is not conserved. This substitution disrupts a G:U wobble base pair, affecting the inhibitory effect on RNA-mediated repression of translation; therefore, the authors predict that the c.*43 G>T variant would lead to less available REEP1 protein, however in the absence of functional studies the actual affect of this variant is unknown (ZÃ¼chner et al., 2006). The c.*43 G>T variant is observed in 83/66706 (0.12%) alleles from individuals of non-Finnish European background, in large population cohorts (Lek et al., 2016; 1000 Genomes Consortium et al., 2015; Exome Variant Server). Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is a pathogenic variant or a rare benign variant.",?,,G,T,,,

This variant has been reported in families affected with Lynch syndrome that meet Amsterdam criteria. Segregation within these families was not reported for this variant (PMID: 17312306, 23729658). However, this variant has been observed to segregate with colon cancer in a single family (Invitae database). ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 90230). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of sequence changes on RNA splicing suggest that this variant may alter RNA splicing. Experimental studies have shown that this intronic change leads to exon 6 skipping, although the data was not made available for review (PMID: 23729658). In summary, this variant is a rare intronic change that has been reported in affected individuals with evidence of segregation with disease. It also reportedly disrupts mRNA splicing. This evidence indicates that the variant is pathogenic, but additional data is needed to prove that conclusively. Therefore, this variant has been classified as Likely Pathogenic.. GeneDx summary: This variant is denoted MLH1 c.454-13A>G or IVS5-13A>G and consists of an A>G nucleotide substitution at the -13 position of intron 5 of the MLH1 gene. MLH1 c.454-13A>G has been observed in at least two individuals with colon cancer, both of which demonstrated microsatellite instability and loss of MLH1 on immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Lagerstedt Robinson 2007, Grandval 2012).

In silico splicing models are inconsistent; therefore, in the absence of RNA or functional studies, the actual effect of this variant is unknown. The adenine (A) nucleotide that is altered is not conserved across species. The International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours Incorporated (InSiGHT) classifies this variant as having uncertain significance due to insufficient evidence (Thompson 2014).

For these reasons, this variant has been classified as Pathogenic. OMIM summary: In a Japanese patient who died of CACT deficiency, Fukushima et al. (2013) identified compound heterozygous mutations in the SLC25A20 gene: a T-to-G transversion in intron 2 (c.199-10T-G) and W192X (613698.0008). Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations. In a patient with CACT deficiency (CACTD; 212138), Ogawa et al.

This pathogenic variant destroys the canonical splice donor site in intron 3, and is expected to cause abnormal gene splicing. OMIM summary: In a girl with p67-phox-deficient chronic granulomatous disease (233710) who was 4 years old at the time of her death, Patino et al. (1999) found homozygosity for a G-to-A transition in the first nucleotide in the consensus splice site of intron 4. The mutation led to the production of 3 different species of cDNA: one that lacked exons 3 and 4, a second with a deletion of exon 4, and a third that lacked only the last 5 nucleotides of exon 4. The different skipping was the result of alternative splicing including the use of a cryptic splice site. The girl was homozygous, although the parents were thought to be nonconsanguineous; they were natives of a small town in Mexico.",0,,G,A,,,

For the maternally inherited mutation, deep sequencing of the patient's myocardium confirmed the coexistence of a wildtype and a shorter transcript corresponding to use of an alternative splice donor site and leading to titin truncation after 2,950 N-terminal amino acids, therefore devoid of the TK domain. Semiquantitative protein gels confirmed a moderate reduction of the global titin amount in the patient's samples. For the paternally inherited mutation, genetic interaction assays showed that TK-R260W abrogated interactions with 2 known TK ligands.

(2014) identified a heterozygous G-to-C transversion in intron 10 of the PIK3R1 gene, resulting in an in-frame deletion of exon 10 and removal of a peptide sequence (amino acids 434-475) that is part of an alpha-helix involved in p110 binding. The mutation, which was found by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing, was not found in the Exome Variant Server database or in an in-house control database. In 1 family, a mother and child were affected. The same splice site mutation, resulting from a different nucleotide change (171833.0007), was found in another patient with a similar disorder. Both mutations resulted in a loss of p85-mediated inhibition and caused increased phosphorylation of downstream signaling pathways, consistent with a gain of function. Immunologic studies showed a defect in both B- and T-cell differentiation. In a 32-year-old Turkish woman and a Caucasian American mother and son with immunodeficiency, Lucas et al. (2014) identified heterozygosity for the c.1425+1G-C mutation, which they designated as occurring in intron 11 of the PIK3R1 gene (c.1425+1G-C, NM_181523.2). Sequencing of patient cDNA demonstrated that the mutation causes skipping of exon 11, resulting in an in-frame deletion of residues 434 to 475 of the p85-alpha regulatory subunit. Analysis of PI3K signaling in patient T-cell blasts showed increased phosphorylation of AKT (164730) and downstream targets compared to controls, indicating constitutive hyperactivation of PI3K and AKT. The mutant p85-alpha protein was detected at low levels in patient cells, and overexpression of the mutant in control T cells demonstrated a dominant gain-of-function effect on PI3K signaling. In addition, the authors showed that this hyperactivation is due to qualitatively and quantitatively different binding to, and impaired inhibition of, the p110-delta catalytic subunit (PIK3CD; 602839).",0,,G,C,,,

Each of her parents was heterozygous for 1 of the mutations, neither of which was found in 100 controls. RT-PCR analysis of the intron 34 1-bp insertion did not reveal any abnormally spliced fragments, suggesting retention of intron 34 and creation of a premature termination codon; quantitative RT-PCR was consistent with a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) process. RT-PCR analysis of the intron 57 mutation revealed 4 fragments, including 1 normally spliced and 3 abnormally spliced isoforms, the latter showing intron retention and/or exon skipping predicted to result in a premature termination codon or in-frame deletion; quantitative RT-PCR was consistent with NMD.
